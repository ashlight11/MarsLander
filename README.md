### This code is part of the course MAD (*Models and Algorithms for Decision*)

## Based on this *[Codingame Project](https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mars-lander)*

The aim is to find the best trajectory for a Mars Lander to land on a flat surface.

We will use a genetic algorithm to solve the problem.
